alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;A tennis player usually wins 60% of her matches. After getting a new coach, she won 12 of her next 15 matches. Was this just luck or was her new coach a contributing factor? Lets decide &#10;by calculating a tail probability &#10;We hypothesise that the coach had no effect on her win rate. Her probability of winning a match is then p &#10;0.6 &#10;The probability of winning at least 12 of 15 games, with such a probability is the binomial sum (enter your answer as a sum in Maple notation, see the hint at the end of this question) &#10;c 09050190240 &#10;O To 2 decimal places this evaluates to 0090501902z &#10;She deduces that this represents roughly a 10% &#10;O chance Since this is larger than 5% &#10;O &#10;she is inclined to think &#10;O this was a statistically significant event (i.e. the coach really helped) &#10;@ this was a statistically insignificant event (i e the coach was irrelevant) &#10;Recall: to compute the sum &#10;80 &#10;10-k &#10;k=70 &#10;we would use the Maple command: &#10;sum (binomial (17 , k) * (O . 6) (O . 1) A (10—k) .80) "></p>

alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;The average yield of an acre of corn is 110 bushels. An experiment with a new variety produced the following average yields on 18 plots: &#10;112_8, 125_7, 115.0, 91.7, 103.5, 1298, 110.9, 124.0; 128.0; 121 _5; 126.1, 116.1, 1176, 1297, 1049, 125.3, 92.4, 114_7 &#10;Is the new variety better? While we can't be sure: some statistics will guide us &#10;To investigate, associating a plus sign (+) to each entry larger than 110 , and a minus sign (—) for each entry less than 110 we have U &#10;14 &#10;4 &#10;O minuses. &#10;Assuming an equal likelihood of pluses and minuses; so that p &#10;o &#10;the tail probability of getting U or more successes from N &#10;O pluses and D &#10;18 &#10;samples is (to 3 decimal places) &#10;This is a probability of about ISO,'O &#10;1 &#10;O &#10;S C) (21) c) &#10;k IV-k &#10;This means such a yield was &#10;unlikely to accus by chance &#10;a 015441894± &#10;O , so the new variety is &#10;definitely superior "></p>
