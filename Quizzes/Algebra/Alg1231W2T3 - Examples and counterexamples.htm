alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;The previous question's discussion of counter-examples is worth amplifying. To check that a subset of S is a subspace of a vector space V, it is necessary that each of the properties of a vector &#10;space hold for S However to show that S is not a subspace we only need to find one example of a single property which does not hold. &#10;Which of these &quot;real life&quot; examples are analogous: [select all that apply] &#10;A car is top notch if it always starts &#10;A car is not top notch if it sometimes and sometimes doesn't &#10;Cl Saying a car is not top notch means that it never starts. &#10;To prove that a computer program has a bug, we only need to find one example where it does not work properly &#10;Cl To prove that a computer program has a bug, we need show that it never works properly &#10;To prove that your love is true, he/she ought to be faithful every day &#10;Cl To prove that your love is true, she/he only needs to be faithful once. &#10;Cl To prove that your love is untrue, she/he needs to be unfaithful every day &#10;To prove that your love is untrue, she/he needs only to be unfaithful once. &#10;Okay maybe we are pushing the analogy here, but we hope you get the idea "></p>
