alt="For two sets A and B the Inclusion-Exclusion principle states that &#10;IAU BI = + - IAnBl. &#10;Let A be the set of MATHIA students and B be the set of students who live on campus. Suppose that there are 230 students enrolled in MATHIA this year &#10;and that 80 Of these MATHIA students live on campus. Suppose also that a total Of 570 students live on campus. In set notation this means &#10;IAI = &#10;570 &#10;Thus the total number Of students who are either enrolled in MATHIA or living on campus (or ågth, as that is what our usage Of the word 'or' implies) is &#10;720 "></p>

alt="Let A be the set of primes less than 100 and let B be the set of natural numbers less than 100 which are 1 more than a square (such as 1, 2, 5, 10, etc. &#10;There are 25 primes less than 100, and there are 10 natural numbers less than 100 which are 1 more than a square (such 1, 2, 5, 10, etc). Together there &#10;are 31 natural numbers less than 100 which are either prime or one more than a square. In set notation this means &#10;IBI — &#10;IA U Bl = &#10;How many natural numbers between 1 and 100 prime and one more than a square? 4 &#10;Challenge: What are these primes? Answer as a set: {2, 5, 17, 37} &#10;By the way, are there an infinite number Of primes that are also one more than a square? This is a famous unsolved problem Of number theory! &#10;Recall: the set {1,2,3} in Maple notation is {1 , 2 , 3}. "></p>
