alt="A certain medical test to detect a particular disease (D) has a 99% chance of returning positive (Y) if a person has the disease, and a 98% chance of &#10;returning negative (N) if a person does not have the disease. Suppose 3% of the population has the disease. This situation is described by the following &#10;tree diagram: &#10;D 0.99 &#10;0.03 &#10;0.97 &#10;0.01 &#10;0.02 &#10;DC 0.98 &#10;Recall that P(YID) is a conditional probability, and denotes &#10;@ the probability of getting a positive result (Y) on the test, given that the person has the disease (D) &#10;U the probability of having the disease (D) given that the person gets a positive result (Y) on the test. &#10;From either the diagram or the numbers provided, we see that &#10;0.03 &#10;O P(DC) &#10;0.97 &#10;P(NID) - &#10;P(YIDC) = &#10;P(NIDC) - "></p>

This is an important and perhaps &#10;surprising result that is worth understanding: just because you test positive for something does not guarantee that you actually have it. &#10;Note: your answers should be entered with at_least 2 significant figures Of accuracy.
