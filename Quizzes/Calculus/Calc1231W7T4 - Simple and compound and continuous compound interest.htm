alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;Suppose that Jethro deposits $2000 into an account which pays simple interest of 4% per annum; which we express as the rate r = 0.04. Simple interest means Jethro only earns interest &#10;on the principle $2000 investment After one year the total in the account is $ 2080 &#10;O . After 5 years the total in the account is $ 2400 &#10;Suppose that his friend Marlene deposits $1000 into an account which pays an interest rate of 3% per annum, which we express as the rate r = 0.03 , but compounded monthly Note that &#10;this 3% per annum translates into the rate 0.25% per month. After 1 month Marlene's account contains $ 1000*1.0025 &#10;O , and after 12 months (1 year) it would contain $ &#10;O After three years it would contain $ 1000M 0025&quot; &#10;1000*1 0025* &#10;K) 35 &#10;Note: you can leave complicated expressions like 2000 x 1 + &#10;for MapleTA to evaluate. &#10;If you invest an amount A at an annual interest rate of r per annum, compounded n times per year, how much do you have at the end of the year? Let's derive this important formula. &#10;In first compounding period of — of a year, you earn -h A in interest So after the first period; you would have a total of A(l + In the second period you also earn interest on your &#10;interest, so you would now have a total of A(l + -L)2 _ And so after one year (i.e after all n periods) you would have a total of &#10;O + r)r/n.

alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;Obviously having your interest compounded is preferable to having just a fixed interest But how much better? In the last question you hopefully deduced that an amount &#10;O invested at an annual rate r &#10;times a year would yield after one year &#10;O (which is a number between 0 and 1, with 1 representing 100% interest), but compounded n &#10;Suppose we invest $1000 for 5 years Using a calculator; Maple, or the GeoGebra App at the bottom of the page, determine what is better: &#10;O Simple interest of 20% for 5 years &#10;@ Compound interest of 16% for 5 years (compounded monthly) &#10;12x5 &#10;Note: this amounts to finding what is bigger 1000(1 + 0.2 x 5) or 1000 1 + &#10;Which is better? &#10;@ Simple interest of 10% for 5 years &#10;O Compound interest of 6% for 5 years (compounded monthly) &#10;Which is better (note: since these numbers are so small the geogebra app might not be helpful here) &#10;O Simple interest of 3% for 5 years &#10;@ Compound interest of 2.9% for 5 years (compounded monthly) "></p>

alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;We have seen that ifwe invest an amount A at an annual interest rate r compounded n times in a year then after one year we would have + -L) n. What is the approximate rate of &#10;change of our money? If we consider the first l/n period of a year in which our money goes from A to A (1 + -L) then the change in money is &#10;while the length of the time period (in years) is &#10;At &#10;So the rate of change of money per time is the quotient of these two; which is &#10;At &#10;We conclude that if the time interval is small, then approximately &#10;This is a familiar differential equation, with solution &#10;Cert &#10;Cert/ n &#10;Crt &#10;Cre t &#10;lin &#10;dt &#10;for some constant C. In fact this would correspond to the interest being compounded continuously&quot; In this case C represents tne initial amount "></p>

alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;Suppose a young graduate is depositing money into a bank account continuously at the rate of about $5, 000 per year, and the account earns interest of 4% annually (compounded &#10;continuously). To start with lets say they have $18, 000 in the account Assuming they dont make any withdrawals; how much money is in the account after six years? &#10;In this case the change in money has two contributions: &#10;Cl tax refunds &#10;the savings that are added &#10;the interest earned &#10;Cl donations to charity &#10;Since the interest is being compounded continuously at a annual rate of r &#10;.04 &#10;O the change in money per unit time (a year) is defined by the equation &#10;= 0.04A + 5000. &#10;dt &#10;This will determine A the amount in the account, as a function oftime t. Happily this is a first order linear ODE ' 10 which we know how to solve. The key is rearrange the equation into &#10;the form &#10;- 0.04A = 5000 &#10;and then multiply both sides by an integrating factor, which is &#10;and integrating, not forgetting a constant of integration. Then use the initial condition A (0) &#10;18000 &#10;O to find that constant of integration Motoring through this, we get the answer &#10;so that after 4 years they ought to have, to the nearest dollar; &#10;42812 &#10;-125000 + &#10;O dollars in the account "></p>

alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;Suppose that you took out a college loan totalling $40, 000 with interest of 7.5% that kicks in once you start work. At that point you set up an online payment plan which continuously &#10;deducts money from your pay at a rate which comes out to $9, 000 per year. How much Will you owe after four years? &#10;This also involves a first-order linear differential equation; with the balance of the loan L(t) going up as interest is accumulated, and going down as payments are made. So the rate of &#10;change of L(t) Will involve a positive contribution for the interest; and a negative contribution for the payments: it will be &#10;0.075 &#10;dt &#10;Using our deep knowledge of solving first order linear ODEs, we find that &#10;O L— 9000 &#10;So after four years you will owe, to the nearest dollar, &#10;12011 &#10;dollars &#10;o "></p>
