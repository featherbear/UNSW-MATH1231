alt="Untitled picture.png Machine generated alternative text:&#10;A tank holds 1500 litres of water in which 6000 grams of salt has been dissolved. Brine which contains 7 grams of salt per litre is run in at a rate of 15 litres per minute. (See &#10;below for a picture of the tank). &#10;The solution is thoroughly mixed and is extracted from the tank at the same rate. Let a: be the number of grams of salt in the tank after t minutes. &#10;Based on the information given &#10;• Initially there are 6000 &#10;O grams of salt in the tank. &#10;• salt is being added to the tank at a rate of 105 &#10;• the number of litres in the tank at time t is 1500 &#10;O grams per minute &#10;The salt is evenly distributed in the tank by mixing. Hence if there are a: grams of salt in the tank, then one litre taken from this tank contains x/1500 &#10;grams Of salt, and 15 litres contains — &#10;grams of salt. The change in salt with respect to time is described by the differential equation &#10;100 &#10;— inflow — outflow 105 — —. &#10;dt &#10;100 &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Untitled picture.png Machine generated alternative text:&#10;Inflow &#10;O &#10;O &#10;O &#10;Outflow &#10;O &#10;O &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Untitled picture.png Machine generated alternative text:&#10;The previous question showed how to setup an initial value problem, such as &#10;= 100 - &#10;with the initial condition that 5000 when t O .

alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;One method to solve &#10;dc &#10;= 15 &#10;is to write this as the linear differential equation &#10;9 &#10;dt &#10;dc &#10;50 &#10;9 &#10;Multiplying by the integrating factor &#10;and the right hand side as &#10;exp(9V50) &#10;+ —x = 15 &#10;dt &#10;50 &#10;, we can write the left hand side as &#10;9t &#10;d &#10;xe 50 &#10;dt &#10;Then we integrate both sides of this expression with respect to t. The absence of initial conditions means a constant of integration remains in our answer. How do you prefer to write this? &#10;(both answers are correct) &#10;250 &#10;-9t/50-C &#10;for some constant C &#10;3 &#10;250 &#10;+ Ae¯9t/50 for some constant A. &#10;3 &#10;The limiting value of as t DO is 250/3 "></div>

alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;An unidentified virus infects a small town.
