alt="When does a series converge? This can be a tricky problenm Even for an alternating series; this is not so obvious. The following series baffled many 18th century mathematicians: &#10;Does it converge? One school of thought argued that we could arrange the terms of the series as follows &#10;so that the infinite sum is &#10;so that the infinite sum is &#10;O &#10;O &#10;Others argued we could equally well arrange it in the form &#10;Others argued for a compromise using the partial sum sn of the first n terms: &#10;1 n is odd, &#10;0 n is even. &#10;The infinite sum should be the average value of sn, othepwise known as the Cesäro sum; which is &#10;Sl +82+ &#10;In this course, according to our definition of convergence, this series &#10;diverges &#10;Ernesto Cesäro: 1859 &#10;- 1906_ "></p>

alt="In the 18th century Gottried Leibniz (the same of Calculus fame) came up with a simple criterion called the Alternating series test that applies to particular kinds of alternating series &#10;Theorem: Alternating series test &#10;Suppose that al , a,2, (13, • is a sequence of real numbers such that &#10;i) an &gt; 0 for all n e Z + which is to say the numbers an are all positive, &#10;ii) an 2 an +1 for all n e Z + which is to say the numbers an are monotonically decreasing, which means decreasing or equal, &#10;iii) lim an = 0 which is to say the numbers an approach zero. &#10;Then the alternating series &#10;converges. &#10;For example, consider the alternating series &#10;E = al — a2 -F (13 — — + &#10;1 &#10;1 &#10;1 &#10;32 &#10;33 &#10;Let an &#10;1/3&quot;n &#10;o - Then &#10;i) this is a sequence of positive numbers: an &gt; o &#10;ii) this is a monotonically decreasing sequence, but proving this usually requires a little work The best place to start working is from a statement we can all agree upon, such as &#10;1 &#10;Multiplying both sides of this inequality by 1,'3An &#10;iii) finally &#10;0 gives &#10;1 &#10;lim an &#10;1 "></p>

alt="Suppose the series of positive and negative terms &#10;(1) &#10;converges. There are ftvo types of convergence for this series, which are distinguished by the behaviour of series of positive terms &#10;lall+ + + la41+• &#10;(2) &#10;If series (1) converges but series (2) diverges then we say that series (1) is conditionally convergent.

alt="In the previous question we saw two types of convergence. In contrast; there is only one type of divergence. &#10;Theorem: Suppose an is a sequence of real numbers (positve or negative). If the series &#10;n=l &#10;is divergent, then the series &#10;is divergent. &#10;Let's append this to our table, which gives a complete picture of the types of convergence and divergence. &#10;Types of convergence and divergence &#10;Series an is Series lanl is Series an is called &#10;Divergent &#10;Convergent &#10;Convergent &#10;For example, the series &#10;Divergent &#10;Divergent &#10;Convergent &#10;1 &#10;2 &#10;1 &#10;22 &#10;Divergent &#10;Conditionally Convergent &#10;Absolutely Convergent &#10;1 &#10;1 &#10;1 &#10;23 &#10;24 25 &#10;is not alternating, so Leibniz's alternating series test can not be applied However the series of positive terms is a geometric series, and converges to &#10;2 &#10;22 &#10;23 &#10;24 &#10;25 &#10;an is &#10;Then using the table above, the series &#10;absolutely convergent "></p>
